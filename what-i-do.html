<h1> What I Do </h1>
<img src="" alt="" srcset="">
<p> I am an artist, designer, and publisher based in Southern California. I currently work at a branding agency where I create identity systems for clients.
    <br>
    I have an active art practice, often using 3D-printing & modeling to create sculptures and images. 
    <br> I also run a small press, <a href="https://specialeffects.zone">Special Effects</a>, with my partner.

  <br> I'm in the process of making some shaped frames that I'm pretty excited about right now :)  <br>
